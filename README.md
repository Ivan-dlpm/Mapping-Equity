<h1> Mapping Equity: A GIS Analysis of Nonprofit Service Distribution in Montclair, NJ According to UN Sustainable Development Goals </h1>

<h2>Permeable Pavement Project Description</h2>
This project uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to evaluate how effectively nonprofit organizations in Montclair, New Jersey are spatially aligned with the town’s most vulnerable populations. By integrating nonprofit location data with the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and historical redlining maps, the analysis examines whether nonprofits are situated in neighborhoods with elevated social and historical disadvantage. A second component uses a 500-meter buffer and SDG-based matching to assess whether nonprofits are both physically close to—and thematically aligned with—the needs of key community facilities such as schools, senior housing, health centers, and group homes. The project reveals that most nonprofits cluster in high-vulnerability and historically redlined areas, and that 98% of vulnerable sites have at least one nearby nonprofit offering relevant services. Developed in collaboration with the Montclair Office of Sustainability, the project includes an interactive ArcGIS Online map that allows users to explore organizations, SDG categories, and service gaps in real time. Overall, the work provides a practical spatial equity tool that can guide municipal planning, improve nonprofit coordination, and strengthen future grant proposals.
